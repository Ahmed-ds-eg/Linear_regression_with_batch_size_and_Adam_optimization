# Linear_regression_with_batch_size_and_Adam_optimization
Part of Numerical optimization course at ITI I built Multivariable Linear regression with option of choosing batch size and Adam optimizer  as a optimization technique to enhance the results 
This was numerical optimization couse Practicale exam in ITI 
Here is Adam equation for some illustation
