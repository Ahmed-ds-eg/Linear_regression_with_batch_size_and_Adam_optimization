# Linear_regression_with_batch_size_and_Adam_optimization
Part of Numerical optimization course at ITI I built Multivariable Linear regression with option of choosing batch size and Adam optimizer  as a optimization technique to enhance the results 
This was numerical optimization couse Practicale exam in ITI 
Here is Adam equation for some illustation

tools used :
* numpy 
* pandas 
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* time 
using Adam optimizer with both adaptive batch size and gradient thershoulding model could supress the built in model in terms of r2 score 
* model score in test data   R2 score = 0.9905
* sklearn model in same test data  R2 score = 0.9818
